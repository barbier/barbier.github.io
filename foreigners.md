Hello!
My name is Gabriel Barbier, I'm a front-end developer with 7 years of experience and this is my blog.

As you can see, this blog is my space to spread knowledge between other developers from Brazil, but if you have any questions, help with tech or need a hand with any project, you can hit me on: gabrielnasb AT gmail DOT com or [check some of my projects on github.](https://github.com/barbier "Link para a minha p√°gina no github")
